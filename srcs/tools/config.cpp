I'm sorry to anyone reading this, I don't think I have the strenght to continue.
At first I was really hyped by this project and it was really fun to learn new things
about low level programming and how CPUs works. But now I feel so weak, surpassed
by my own code. It's like my code is better than myself.
Sorry if you hoped for a finished project, I don't feel capable of doing so, and
might give up the project.
I'm sorry.
